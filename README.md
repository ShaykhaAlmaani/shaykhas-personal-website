# 🌐 Shaykha Almaani – Personal Website

This repo currently hosts a **temporary “Coming Soon” page** for my personal website.

### 🧭 Setup notes
- Hosted on **Netlify (Free Plan)**  
- Repo connected to **GitHub → Netlify** for auto-deploy  
- Root file: `index.html` (no build or backend)
- Optional config: `netlify.toml` (for future routing)

### 🪄 Future plans
- Replace the static page with a full portfolio website  
- Add sections: About, Projects, Blog, Contact  
- Possibly integrate with Framer or a custom React frontend  
- Add light/dark themes and animations  

### 📝 Reminder to myself
When the real site is ready:  
1. Update the root structure (`/src` or `/dist`).  
2. Adjust `publish` directory on Netlify.  
3. Add analytics + favicon.  
4. Update this README with setup instructions and credits.
